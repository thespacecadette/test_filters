# Tech test for Finsure

1. Install and run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn mock-api` for BE
3. Run `yarn dev` for FE and open `http://localhost:8080`

## NOTES

For Scenario 1, I couldn't call all records within last 30 days, as there's only 1 by default. If the data had current dates this would have worked. Mock data was from last year. Implementation would have been fast, and functionality would not need to be extended much to cater to this requirement.
